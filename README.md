## Notes

### 1. Why is my git pre-commit hook not executable by default?

- Because files are not executable by default; they must be set to be executable.

```
  chmod ug+x .husky/*
  chmod ug+x .git/hooks/*
```

### 2. Git commit

```shell
  npm run commit
```

### 3. Project release

```shell
  npm run release:patch // Patch release 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1
  npm run release:minor // Minor release 0.1.1 -> 0.2.0
  npm run release:major // Major release 0.2.0 -> 1.0.0
```
